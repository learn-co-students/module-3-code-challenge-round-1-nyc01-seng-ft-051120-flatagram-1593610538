//As a user, I can:

//See the image received from the server, including its title, likes and comments when the page loads
    //function getImages
    //renderImages
    // title: "", likes: , comments: ""

// Click on the heart icon to increase image likes, and still see them when I reload the page
    // remember the function nodefault on refresh on this ^^

// Add a comment (no persistance needed)
