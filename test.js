// ## Core Deliverables

// As a user, I can:

// <!-- - See the image received from the server, including its title, likes and comments when the page loads -->

// <!-- - Click on the heart icon to increase image likes, and still see them when I reload the page -->

// - Add a comment (no persistance needed)
